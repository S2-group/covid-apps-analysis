        "pretty good app...it lets you pick locations you want to monitor and it lets you customize the weather settings so youre not pestered to death about things you dont need to know about...i need to figure out if l can fine tune it however...l'm still getting silly things in the middle of the night like it will be \"windy\" today or \"foggy\"...thats all well and good...just not at 0300.",
        "The app did work great. I got a Samsung A10 and for some reason the notifications stopped working properly. The weather notifications are intermittent and my reminders for emergency kit, smoke detectors, etc. don't come through at all anymore. Suggestions? I'd like to give higher marks.",
        "The weather alert tab is missing Indland Hurricane Warning, Inland Hurricane Watch, Inland Tropical Storm Warning, Inland Tropical Storm Watch, Hurricane Force Wind Warning, and Snow Squall Warning.",
        "A good app from the government? Shocker. In all seriousness it's actually very useful. I like being able to keep updated on the town my family lives in as well as where I am now. I used to use the \"Emergency\" app from the Red Cross for this purpose. However this app is better because it shows less severe alerts. For example I live in a low lying area so it's good to get flood notifications, even if it's just a watch. Same with high surf warnings. The Red Cross app only shows high level alerts.",
        "Alerts are way too excessive.. It's a little windy in my area and I get notifications what feel like every 5 minutes. Had to delete the app because it was so annoying.",
        "Amazing app, which works well with Notify NYC. Both are extremely accurate real time tools.",
        "Pretty good app, tons of info would have given it a 5 star if it had downloadable prepping lists. It doea have check lists in the app, but no way to download",
        "Great system keeps me informed, especially with severe weather conditions/warnings. I live in a flood zone and this is extremely helpful.",
        "Has more capabilities than any weather app. I'm a weather freak, but this app is the only one I use for weather notifications. All the other app's (about 5 or so) notifications are off. And this one has additional serious notifications.",
        "This is a great app. Warns you about amber alerts in your area and any kind of danger.",
        "When I click on \"Alerts,\" I get a message saying that I have to enable them in the app settings. But when I get into the settings, I can't find anything that does that.",
        "Just download this app for coronavirus updates. Looking for something that will show me where the highest concentrations of COVID 19 is in my county. I'm not going anywhere, just curious. I'm in a more rural part of Oakland Co. The last article 'update' was Tuesday, March 24, 2020. Today is Friday, March 27, 2020. Goodbye!",
        "Very helpful getting things together after a disaster is hard to do .this app helps keep it organized and leaves a easy trail to keep your affairs on the right track.",
        "The maps are blurry. It does not give necessary information about disaster areas. It often fails to report disasters in poverty stricken areas.",
        "Wonderful App allows 5 different locations and multiple weather related, earthquakes, more...",
        "Always be ready disaster don't wait .. great app and a wealth of knowledge and information.",
        "Excellent app to prepare for all types of emergencies!",
        "Push notifications work but information doesn't show in app.",
        "App does not work. Will not accept any locations.",
        "Works great for local alerts of events.",
        "The Gov Doesn't Eff Around When It Comes To App And Game Dev... IE America's Army (Free PS4) And A Few Other Games On Diff Platforms \ud83c\udf0e\ud83c\udf0d\ud83c\udf0f\ud83c\udf97\ufe0f\ud83c\udf08\ud83c\udf00\ud83c\udf7b",
        "Needs to be updated with covid-19 alerts and or features",
        "This fema is the greatest app to have all alerts to keep u on alert at all times",
        "Would you PLEASE stop sending alerts every few hours about snow on the mountains. It's winter and there will be snow! THIS IS HARDLY A F.E.M.A. LEVEL EMERGENCY! I have been getting these alerts many times a day for months and they often don't even have new info. I am sent these messages even though they are well outside my chosen range of counties. All you are doing is causing people to delete the app from sheer annoyance. Seriously, if I want regular weather updates I will use a weather app",
        "Have Not Used As Yet ! Sorry,but must be so much of a great service I would believe.. Rev.RubyFDurkee..",
        "Excellent, well thought-out and very easy to use!",
        "FEMA is supposed to be the lead agency in responding to a national disaster. Under Donald Trump's direction, FEMA was defunded to pay for his wall. The appropriate leadership resigned or were fired, and the money went towards paying for his wall. Now this useless app is nothing but Trump appointees patting Trump on the back and calling him a good boy when they should be directing resources to help Americans. It makes me sick and disgusted at Trump and his lackeys in the GOP.",
        "Very helpful. Easy to use.",
        "Lots of great information! Thank you for all that has been done by FEMA, whether our weather conditions, being at the ground level of a hurricane helping people get out, assisting those in need of financial help, or something amazing like this app!!! This app has checklists, your location list of possible disasters, and even has texts to set up for warnings/information. What a blessing! Thanks for all the work yall do!",
        "Glad it's here but not really sure how useful it is yet.",
        "I can not rate my experience as it is ongoing until time ends I can not rate anything regarding this app I do not have the technical knowledge nor the equipment to program frequencies to effect any good out come to a very com text tool in a a very complex world so I am waiting for one to arrive who is worthy to accomplish these goals I am not the one today who will the one that I shall be tomorrow.",
        "Always up to date on things.",
        "The app has had its ups and downs, but it was working for a while. Now it has stopped sending notifications, which makes it useless unless you want to open the app and check each location to see if there have been any alerts. The point is to GET the alerts, not have to keep checking to see if there have been any. 12/18/18 Still was not getting a single alert... Uninstalled, downloaded again -- working now!",
        "Worthless for warnings! Makes no sound!",
        "The good: Timely alerts, often well ahead of other apps. Seems lightweight and works ok on throttled cellular. The bad: Alerts seem to be only accessible from the notification? Devs please advise/patch.",
        "Hasn't been updated in months. The first time I opened it, it crashed. I ran it again and with no clear instructions, found it difficult to use. Too complicated and and has unnecessary stuff for a simple weather alert app. I recommend the Red Cross app if you just want notifications and not a complete weather app.",
        "This app is great for storm season, and off season. The app provides timely alerts. The problems I have are 1. I sleep through my message tone. Customisable alert tones, maybe a different tone for each section, would make sure I receive life saving alerts in the middle of the night. Fix that and I'll give 5 stars 2. Less important is a radar map.",
        "A tornado watch was issued by this app in the notification bar!!! No sounds at all!! A wind chime with a video stream would be more useful than this app is. Spoken warnings preceded by an audible alarm that alert you to locations/counties under a watch or warning (as it use to be), should be mandatory on all weather apps. Access to NOAA Radio/National Weather Service alerts and conditions for your current location should not be hard to find, as these are funded by taxes.",
        "this app is good. it needs adjustment though. i need to be able to turn off vibration and sound alerts. i was woken up at 730am because the app wanted me to know the roads were slick. this was really annoying because i turned off the winter weather alerts, knowing that this kind of thing would happen on a daily basis because i live in a snowy area. i want this app to alert me when there is an emergency, not an everyday weather happenstance.",
        "I guess I haven't paid much attention because I also get alerts in other ways but this app doesn't appear to be sending me notifications anymore. The only reason I noticed this now is because the Google Play store gave me a notification there was an update. I am subscribed to all alerts for two different locations so I am not sure what the value of this app is currently. Edit: Thanks. This is now fixed."
