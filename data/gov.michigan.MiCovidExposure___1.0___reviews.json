It doesn't appear to use much battery, even though it hopefully is working all the time. Otherwise it would be pointless. My only problem is the stats displayed don't match the most recent data on the website. That seems simple enough for the developers to get working right.",

While I did not give it 5 stars (due to just getting the app) I did want to comment and let you know that I appreaciate it.",
