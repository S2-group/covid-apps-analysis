    "description": "Care19 Alert is the official COVID-19 exposure notification app for North Dakota and Wyoming as authorized by each states Department of Health. \r\n\r\nCare19 Alert allows you to receive notifications if you have been near someone who has tested positive for Covid-19 recently.  Care19 Alert uses Apple\u2019s Exposure Notification API to help reduce the spread of the coronavirus, with user privacy and security central to its design. \r\n\r\nCare19 Alert maintains your privacy while securely communicating with nearby iOS and Android devices that also have exposure notifications enabled. This happens through the exchange of random keys that change every 15 minutes. These keys are stored securely on your device and hidden from the Care19 Alert application. All keys remain on your device and are not accessible unless you have tested positive for COVID-19, been contacted and verified by the Department of Health, and consent to sharing the random keys with others.\r\n\r\nCare19 Alert allows you to notify others if you test positive for COVID-19 and it will notify you if someone you came in contact tested positive for COVID-19. With your permission, your key/date pairs will be securely uploaded to the National Key Server run by the Association of Public Health Laboratories.  All uploaded key/date pairs are distributed to all of the devices connected to the National Key Server. \r\n \r\nThe downloaded keys are matched by the operating system based on criteria established by each Department of Health, and if you have a match you will be notified of the exposure and provided by your department of Health with the set of actions to take provided.",

        "I see my review got deleted. Here is my thoughts. I have to turn off and on wifi with bluetooth all the time for a chance for this app to work and log. Please allow the app to control Bluetooth and notify when it isnt truly working and option to turn on and off bluetooth automatically for it to work. Simple programing and still not working right.",
        "Disappointed...was exposed to person on 22nd...who began symptoms on 24th, tested positive on 25th. I was notified by state as a close contact (within 48 hours of symptoms) and to quarantine 14 days. We both have the apps on phones and Bluetooth turned on. The positive person 'notify button' was not activated until 30th. I received zero notification from the app. Needs some work from what I experienced.",
        "I think this is a great way of keeping track of where you have been and who you could possibly come into contact with, without any effort.",
        "This is an anonymous way of doing contact tracing. Great Job!",
        "Contacted the developers asking why Wyoming residents need to contact the Wisconsin department of health as stated on the \"notify\" screen. Received a canned response that had nothing to do with my question.",
        "Should not have a location requirement! More coerced privacy invasion from Google APIs.",
        "With ND's depressing lack of proper response to COVID-19, I was afraid this might not exist for the area. Thank you.",
        "We all need to take positive action to control the spread of the virus. It is our responsibility to keep us all safe.",
        "Add support for SD, please!",
        "This app was no good it gave me covid",
        "Doesn't work in sd Edit: spelling",
        "Seems like a good app but here's a question, will this app be effective even though I am in Colorado? Will it be effective in another state",
        "I didnt open it at all",
