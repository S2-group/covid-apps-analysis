        "*Love* the design and ease of installation. Good job Guam and Path Check Foundation! Bias toward action. I like the transparency around privacy, but I wish there were external links to a credible audit of the open source code so that the in-app marketing assertions could be 3rd-party verified. I don't live in Guam and don't work as a Path Check developer, so I can't judge how the EN functionality works, but as an interested consumer, I say thumbs up.",
        "Cool, whatever helps, even if the app isn't what everybody expected, atleast it's a value and can probably get you started on preperation.",
        "The app won't open",
        "It does what's it supposed to. I feel better knowing this app is available to help If the need arises.",
        "HOW WILL I KNOW WHEN SOMEONE IS INFECTED? I ALWAYS HAVE TO KEEP MY BLUETOOTH ON. I WISH THIS APP WILL LET ME KNOW IF SOMEONE NEXT TOO ME IS INFECTED WITH COVID-19.",
        "I'm just curious as to why Bluetooth has to be turned on",
        "It doesn't open",
        "Do people really think someone positive would report it in this app for nearby people to know",
        "The best!",
        "Easy onboarding",
