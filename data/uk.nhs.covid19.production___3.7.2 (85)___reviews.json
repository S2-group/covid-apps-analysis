Similar to others, I received the infamous \"potential covid exposure\" alert, followed by the NHS app telling me that I'm ok, don't worry - and that's it. No extra info, not even a log about the alerts. I know that in the background, on the system level, the tracing works by collecting Bluetooth ids (MAC addresses, probably) from other devices, but this mean what if I'm in a traffic jam, I'll pick up the people around me, regardless of being fairly well shielded from the rest. Apparently the first notification - the exposure one - comes from the system level whenever it makes makes a match against the encountered vs the downloaded and known to be sick database - and sends the alert immediate. The NHS app then dives into the data, and checks the potential distance and exposure time; if it's bad, the app will tell you to self-isolate; if not, you'll get nothing, but another notification, that practically says \"false alarm, you're ok\". Recommendations to the engineers: - clicks on any of the notifications should take the user to a log of events - these events should have a timestamp at least and, if recorded, a location, about when and where the exposure might have happened - information on why the NHS app decided that this potential exposure is not a risk Without these it's very easy to get stressed and frightened.",

Once I click on the notification it just disappears. Sometimes I get a follow up message saying that there is no risk and no further action is necessary. Again, when you click on it its disappears. Be nice to know where the contact was as I travel a lot for work all round the country and need more information. Lots of room for improvement.",
