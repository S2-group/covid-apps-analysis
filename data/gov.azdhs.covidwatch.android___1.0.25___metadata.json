        "The idea is great/it is easy to set up/explains how it works well. I will rate 5 simply for that. It definitely needs to be able to be discovered by searching 'covid arizona' or 'covid watch arizona'. I had to look it up on a search engine then go through an app store link on the dev's website to find it.",

        "Apparently, it's not available in for most of Arizona even if the menu lists Arizona along with two university systems. You need to be upfront about this. What \"region\" am I in and what \"local\" officials are you waiting for permission from?",
