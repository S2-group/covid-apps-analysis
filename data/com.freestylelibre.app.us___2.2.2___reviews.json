You can use the app to read a Freestyle activated with the DR. Why wouldn't you assume the reverse without a warning. Support just says refer to 2 pages on the manual.",

I want to know why FreeStyle developers have not yet made this application compatible with the Android flagship phone of the Pixel 4 (Pixel 5 is even starting to come out soon). Why bother making it compatible with a Pixel 3? The Pixel 3 hardware has been out of support for nearly two years. I like the freestyle sensor and included meter but I very much want to get this data on my phone instead of a separate meter. To not support the Google Pixel 4 at this time and date is a gross dereliction of responsibility. In response to the Abbott response below, the link you have provided gives an ERROR. Second, regarding Google's current flagship phone not supporting standard, Google OWNS Android. The Google Pixel IS the standard. Perhaps you should contact Google to see what they have to say about it.",

I just hate having to delay an OS upgrade install and all the \"good stuff\" that comes with it to wait for the Freestyle app to be upgraded. This happens every year and there are betas of the Android OS out there early ... doesn't seem to be a priority for Abbott.

The glucose level jumps by increments of 50, so it's very difficult to tell whether the value is 120 or 135 when looking at the graph. Zooming would help this, but why not have increments of 10 instead? Secondly, it would be nice to be able to save or share the graphs and include the notes. Right now sharing the graph is basically just a screen shot. Thanks.",

Accompanying app for the PC/Mac is still 32bit and does not install on all OS. Avoid Freestyle Libre if you can so that you don't get stuck with a useless app and reader you can download data from. 2019: it will be nice if the app stopped you from starting a new sensor or at least gave you a warning would have been nice. Because once you start the sensor using the app, the meter that you share with your doctor is unable to read the sensor. Bad design.",

They are 2 older models, One is A Note the other is a tiny LG, however, so far, 2 new models I tried to use with this product simply wont work even with the latest NFC technology on them.. That's crazy! I would request that this company expand their testing on more newer Android brands and phones.. That would Help. I am not a big fan of the new Samsung Phones, but it appears that is the brand the company loves to keep up with for Android Phones. The idea was for me to use this system with a good updated cell phone, but it appears unless I get a Samsung my options are quite limited. I am surely not a proprietary Apple fan. Well, i have 2.5 months of Freestyle Libre sensors left and will still be hunting for a good cell phone I can start using with this product without getting one of the few they have tested. Good Luck Too Me!",

Google had put out some updates and I get the NFC to beep every time I pass the phone now but they have blocked installing on the phone so you can even try to use it. I emailed the company and all I get is the canned response, we do not support hacked phones. It is completely stock and unlocked but has the latest updates. If someone at the company would either confirm it is still not working or at least unlock the app so we can install it, please do so as calling Libre support is a waste of breath. I will need to start looking for a competitor to the Libre that does work if they are this unresponsive and I do not want to carry around the reader. Please Just answer the question online as I am not the only one asking this question. Every response is call us. Is this a bot? And the online response is just a link to to a web page repeating it is incompatible with the Pixel 4 call google for a fix. I am saying google has done a fix for nfc but I can't get anyone at Abbott to check to see if there are still issues on their end. Just stuck in this endless circle.

Like most of the reviews for this App, the lack of a GOOD interface with other devices is appalling. Also the lack of a GOOD interface with the FreeStyle Libre Software is very disappointing. I mean, the technology is available so Abbott should be very abreast of how to use it. But obviously, seems like Abbott is not really interested in HELPING the way they should. Looks to me that the ONLY interest is in selling the Reader/Sensor Kit and (not that I am against it) make lots of money off of it.Shame n you!!!! This App should have a direct interface with the Software and with the Reader itself. It would be quite useful to be able to connect with the reader to complement the data between the App and the Reader. That would make much better reports fr the patient and the doctor to analyze if need be. Come on Abbott!!!! Get it together and start working on this. And if you are going to respond telling me to call Customer Support, they better have GOOD ANSWERS for my questions. Hope this helps. And Abbott, read all the other reviews AGAIN and take notes. There are a lot of good suggestions going on,",

I am just into 3 days of the 14 day sensor which is now completely useless since it is 'initialized' w/ this app so the reader won't read! Any fix for Android 10? update1: For the developer note below: As I mentioned, if you start the sensor with App your reader refuses to read so basically, I wasted $30 sensor and would like to know an ETA for a fix for Android-10 before I put in another sensor. No I don't want to use reader. The note earlier said you are working on a fix, now that is removed and replaced with this canned response below! update2: I am downgrading the rating to 1 due to complete lack of response from app developers (except the canned response), clueless people behind the support phone line, not to mention bouncing support e-mail.

I KNOW it's ready, I've been using it for 9 days. Excessive alerts in my notification bar just leads to sensory fatigue which leads to ignoring notifications. I don't want notifications that I have to ignore. In short, anyone who needs to be notified every few hours that their sensor is ready probably isn't compentent enough to be making use of the sensor in the first place. This is bad programming. Please fix this glitch. P.S. Don't tell me to call the help center again, they made me spent 20 minutes uninstalling and reinstalling the app, which made no difference whatsoever. It's a coding problem, not a problem with my particular installation.",

HOWEVER, I am finding that the readings with the app are much lower, a minimum of 60 points, than the actual BG. Example: the scanner read that I had a 64 BG but my finger stick read 124. That is a big difference. I have been watching it closer for the last month and a half because of this. When I start my last sensor for the month, I will use the reader that I was given and compare that to the app as well.",

Of course I was unable to find this out until after the app was installed on the phone and now I'm having issues with readings. So now it's back to using the reader for consistent readings - going back in time... when will the new Pixel 4 phones be added and app updated? UPDATE 1/8/2020: was told to call the \"855\" number to be \"Better Assisted\" (on 12/29/2019) and did so today. Their customer service is not equipped to handle technical calls. I was given no new information - called and wasted time for nothing - will NOT change rating. This App is Useless if you have a Pixel 4 phone.",

I originally sent an email but again didn't get a response. I like the app and do not want to give it a negative review. As before I hope that this is an issue that is addressed and solved",

I should have just stayed with the 10 day sensor that had 3rd party support and applications that got updates. Edit for developer response: The customer care line does absolutely nothing, they make no effort to understand the device I am using or the scanning issues. No assurance was made that anything was going to be looked into or fixed in the future only a suggestion of using a different phone.",

I can swipe away the reminder and it can pop right back up in a 3 day peirod I could get over 50 reminders that is the worst . the lesser of the 2 problems is that when I start a new sensor and tells me it is ready and I scan it will pop up agan and tell me it is ready up to 3 times a day for a week even though I keep scanning . I have been told by Abbott to turn off the Notifications but then the reminders I have set to reminde me to scan at least every 7 hours will not be displayed and I do not want to loose data since it only holds 8 hours I do wish it would be a real CGM that just kept sending to the phone then I would not need the reminders .",

It is either the Android phone or the reader,, NOT both. Only option IMHO is to start a new sensor. In my case, i lost 80% of sensor use due to Abbot Labs screw up. They should pay for this loss.
