We are still waiting for the source code ... the app is only a very small part of the overall system. In particular the real security issues are at the database end which I expect is being developed behind closed (commercial in confidence) doors. I hope that source and (if it is in the cloud) the operating system setup that it is using (including current versions of the whole system running it) is also open sourced. In this case the cloud is not just a storage area it is where the database is run under an operating system. Possibly with lots of back doors ready to be opened. So still waiting for the third party security experts to get their teeth into the code and infrastructure running this. So my local version is not activated yet....",
