        "Does not work for current android phones would not even open.",
        "Very poorly made app. Incredibly buggy.",
        "The app crashes alot.",
        "This latest version is almost useless for searching an area's restaurants. Basically, it's what you would expect from a governmental agency. Unfortunately, you and I are paying for it."
