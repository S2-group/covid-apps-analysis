        "Here's an idea: how about you fund mental health properly? This app has some useful tools but it's not the same as real therapy with a human being on the other end.",
        "Cumbersome, too difficult to manage, not effective or useful due to level of effort to interfaces.",
        "Cannot switch to french.... French veteran'd dont or do you beleive we cannot get ptsd",
        "Veterans Affairs. Good job. Well done.",
        "Assist in my focus toward an emotional and mental state of clarity and more calmness throuh my daily life. There are good reminders in thIs app about the simple things that can be done to bring serenity to oneself.\tFor myself with a sustained severe traumatic brain injury ovet 20 yrs ago a number of my symptoms were listed as ptsd like. The techniques used in this app are so beneficial to my sense of mental clarity. They are some Ive used for a long tome and some are new.",
        "This is  good even if you don't have PTSD its just great for  every day life the best app I have found,  just wish it didn't come along with the stigma of PTSD",
        "I use this to teach basic self-regulation skills, and also for home use with my family. The visual breathing exercise is gold... Perfect for those who are have difficulty \"taking a breath\" when anxious or stressed. Great resource!",
        "Samsung 26th - Nougat 7.0, will not install. Error 504, have tried every trick I can think of, (including a cold restart), issue persists. Help",
        "The government puts so much weight on out dated research. Its studying the \neffects of war as perceived in the 80s. That's how far behind it is and yet \nthat's not even close to the right generation. Our boys have been asked to \ndo something for their country that the country doesnt even understand and \nthe government thinks a little app will make fix the optics ... cute",
        "PTSD coach Canada cannot be installed   this is the message I keep receiving, great waste of money to create a uses app"
