This new version has fixed this and the interruption is now very brief, 1 second or a bit less. Congrats to the dev team! I still hit a minor issue: my phone# was rejected when I tried to register. Closing and opening the app fixed the glitch.",

        "content": "We'll have to wait and see the effectiveness of this app until there are some infected people and they do contact tracing using this. In the mean time, I start with a major issue; 1. The app is significantly disruptive to bluetooth audio streaming. Causing the audio to pause every few seconds. This was observed during a drive on the highway. It seems that the interruption is more frequent the faster you travel and by the number of phones in the vicinity. Phones in the vicinty can disrupt the audio playing from another phone's bluetooth. Switching off bluetooth in the nearby phones stopped the breaks in the audio streaming. I think this is a major issue especially since more and more people are using bluetooth headphones especially in public transport and the app will become useless if people get annoyed and uninstall it for this reason. 2. The app asks for locations permission when installing. Some people maybe be off put by this thinking that it is recording their location. However I think the location is used so that the app can conduct it's handshake when it knows you've moved location rather than it explicitly recording your location (happy to be corrected). 3. The app seems fairly unobtrusive after 4 weeks of use. Battery drain is not significantly higher (running a Note 9 with Android 10)",

I noticed on the second data reset I activated the COVID app first then, whilst setting the phone back up to it's usual operation, I wasn't able to connect to my Smart watch via bluetooth or my bluetooth headset. When I deactivated the COVID app I was able to connect to these devices. When I deleted the COVID app I was able to download and update apps from Play Store. I like the concept of the app but not if it blocks my notifications and causes my phone not to operate correctly. My wife has it installed on Note 10 and all seems fine.",
