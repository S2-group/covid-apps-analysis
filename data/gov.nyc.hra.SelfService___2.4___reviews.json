If you can renew your case on the COMPUTER, means that will be easier to submit the document on the go (which is STEP 2), why should you require to download the APP and do it all over again? Then to the APP, you can only sign up an account, can't even get to the second step because the system could not find a match of your information. What a nightmare!!!
