The classes offered at the office are ok for snacks. The last class I was in literally said freeze yogurt for a healthy snack. Ok here's your checks. Maybe show how to prepare a healthy fast dinner instead of snacks. It would be a great option to be able to have one on one classes with a registered dietitian if requested to assist families in learning to cook healthy, read nutrition labels and help make better food choices for their family maybe do a shopping trip with them (build a classroom store) and cooking lessons to make a healthy meal option and teach portion sizes.",
