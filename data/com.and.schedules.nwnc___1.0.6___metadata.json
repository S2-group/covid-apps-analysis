        "I have been using your website for pool reservations at Jerry Long, for several weeks, successfully. But now, when I find an open lane, fill out the name and birth date info, and click \"reserve\", nothing happens, other than to blank the boxes that I just filled in. Result is I don't get a reservation for a lane that presumably is open and available. Bummer I Called the Y about this some day last week, but to no avail!. Double bummer!",
        "I have the same problem as Moss. The app does not take my registration. I give up!",
        "Would be nice when you search a class you could see what day and which location it is at. When I search a class it shows me the day I am on now I have to click on each day to see if it is even located at the location I selected. Not very user friendly. Could use alot more updating. No water fitness schedule.",
        "Doesn't seem to work. Won't let me make pool reservations with it. Needs to be updated.",
        "Desperately needs an update. Only lets me sign up for classes 30% of the time. Otherwise states \"malformed\" errors or does not send automatic email for confirmation.",
        "Doesn't work for the newest Android update.",
        "I cant login.",
        "Doesn't go past load screen.",
        "Never see anything but the load screen",
