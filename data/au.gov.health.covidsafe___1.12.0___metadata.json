        "It's probably great but my poor old Android's battery can't handle the strain from running Bluetooth and keeps on switching it off. And, yes, I've checked all the phone settings. Sorry Federal Government. I can't help. Now uninstalled. UPDATE... New phone, now works quietly in the background.",
        "The app still will not let me register. When entering my mobile number for registering, I keep getting the error message \"Please try again later.\" Please address this - not being able to register renders the app useless. Also means I'm not going to be notified if I have contact with a confirmed covid19 case - so I'm not protected.",
        "Happy to do my bit to help out with covid management. Having said that my battery usage has gone through the roof since last update. COVIDSafe is at the top of my battery use list by a country mile. Hopefully the update I have done this morning will fix.",
        "When I have WIFI on, it says \"No Internet Connection\" but running on a mobile without WIFI, it connects. Why? My WIFI has internet connection, but this COVIDSafe app refuses to use it. Seems pretty stupid to me, that it can't connect for updates etc...",
        "Pointless as it only works if I have GPS on all day which flattens the battery. So I've had it installed for months, but hardly ever works as I disable GPS most of the time. Wouldn't it be better to still capture near Bluetooth device details regardless of location by GPS?",
        "Obliterates my battery even when I'm working from home and don't leave the house all day (so wouldn't expect a lot of Bluetooth handshakes going on). Also seems to interfere with Bluetooth connections to already paired devices intermittently.",
        "Its become very confused and now will not run unless my GPS is turned on. I am not happy about this. My phone will no longer connect to car bluetooth. This is a new problem not seen by me before. With all these issues i will be unistalling until the App works better.",
        "Why is this app always on without having to turn LOCATIONS some phones and not others? Both our phones are same make and mine is newer model, yet I have to manually turn Location on even though I gave given it permission to be on all the time. Why is this?",
        "Would be nice if it had a built-in QR reader so it can provide my encrypted details when checking-in to restaurants, so I don't have to give them my personal details.",
        "Would like to see how many \"close contacts\" this thing has picked up and even a dashboard somewhere showing nationwide app performance- case numbers are available elsewhere on the net. And yeh, the gps requirement is a worry.",
        "Politically motivated addition of case numbers - totals rather than active, and no actionable breakdown. Still relying on sub-optimal homegrown solution rather than leverage Google/Apple platform. No data so prove that it actually delivers any benefit",
        "Why has the Covid app. Changed, I used to be able to keep updated on Queensland cases, now I only get an over view of all cases! Which means I am unable to check to see if there are any new cases in Qld. Not Happy!",
        "Ineffective. It takes only a few seconds to become infected, but this app takes minutes before it register a contact. The idea is good but, the implementation is not a functional tracker.",
        "Seems to be working with no dramas. Doesn't appear to be affecting my battery life much (Samsung Galaxy s9).",
        "Says my phone number is invalid. I double checked my phone number. Still comes up as invalid.. Update. Monday 22st September Still says my phone number is invalid.",
        "Initially worked ok but hasn't worked for a few months now. Back working again.",
        "Latest version requires Location to be switched ON to work As I never have location ON the app is now useless I assume. The earlier version of the app only needs Location permission, with Location turned off the app still works, no longer.",
        "I hope its just me. Sometimes randomly I have to briefly turn bluetooth off, to get mt wifi to work again. Then I forget to reactivate bluetooth. Android phone. There is nowhere on the covidsafe website to put technical feedback. No feedback is not really good for quality control. How will you know if its working, until you need it and then its too late.",
        "In theory: great idea In practice: horrendous. Privacy invasive, breaks bluetooth, crashes constantly, doesn't automatically start at boot most of the time, drains battery life at places like a school, does in app updates which breaks itself. I get you need to have an app like this but Google and apple has added contact tracing into their os, and from what has been said it works better.",
        "Happy to use but better if app turns on automatically when Bluetooth and GPS is on, shows active case numbers, doesn't require GPS (drains battery).",
        "Had no troubles, works ok from day1 of release. Now i find out the phone app had battery optimization enabled which prevents app from running correctly. Uninstalled + reloaded as i thought app was the issue. Then used PC and Google to locate how to ensure no optimization on the app. I only turn bluetooth on when i leave home. So no battery issues.",
        "I've had no issues before. After the recent update, however, it now requires me to have location turned on for my phone (previously the app needed permission to access location, but didn't need it turned on). I don't want to turn location on, so I sort of wish I hadn't updated it now, as I'm now reluctant to do everything required to make it work.",
        "App reports green and working in status bar, but when I tap on the app status, it opens showing it's not working because either GPS or Bluetooth is turned off, and I did not turn either of these off. Confusing. Concerning more so because I discover this halfway through or after a day out!! If mine doesn't work reliably, does anyone else's? If it's not working reliably for everyone what's the protection level? I supported and pushed the concept of this app and still do. Get your act together!",
        "This app causes me so many problems with my Bluetooth speaker, Bluetooth phone to car connection, and Bluetooth wireless headphone to phone connection. Bluetooth signal drops out, very frustrating as one of the main uses for my phone is to listen to media, audio books, podcasts etc using this technology. It's very frustrating and I'm considering deleting the app because of these issues. People will not want to download this app with annoying problems like these that aren't fixed.",
        "Huge drain on battery, to the point that I have to turn it off while I'm out and about to avoid my phone dying halfway through the day. Which defeats the purpose of the app. Since the last update of the app on my Galaxy s20 the notification prompt which persists is: \"covidsafe is not active\" although when I open the app is says \"covidsafe is active, no further action is required\".",
        "No longer works after latest update. In fact, it asks me to register again... which I cannot do (the 'continue' button on the first details screen doesn't do anything). Cannot even restore the prior version that I have backed-up. Someone's made a heck of a mess of what was initially unnecessary (use the mobile phone towers to identify/locate phones). Removed until a working version is again available... *annoyed*.",
        "After latest update the app is showing \"not active\" unless location is turned on. I don't understand why it needs this, I thought it was all based on bluetooth. Since GPS drains my battery will not be turning it on unless I'm going out (if I remember). Upside is I won't bother having bluetooth turned on all the time either.",
        "Yes it installs on 5.1 now but gets stuck after enabling Bluetooth. Proceed does not enable battery optimisation off and Bluetooth location. Oppo R7+ with ColorOs. The new version starts bu reports not connected to internet while the phone is connected to internet. App 'report problem' fails. Is it of any use without Internet?",
        "It keeps turning itself off saying I need to disable battery optimization which is not on. The app has a problem.",
        "Latest update needs location services on. Why is that? It did not before. Gov web site says it does not record my location. Location services should not be needed. (Edit) It seems it needs access to location service, but location service can be turned off. Also app help says this is an Android limitation, location is not actually used.",
        "Latest update (3 Aug) has possibly caused battery issues. Updated the app yesterday (app now asks for location) and I've noticed today my battery is already below 50% half-way through the day when I normally get to the end of the day with 70-80% remaining. I'll keep monitoring it as Android can just have \"battery drain days\" so it's hard to say if it's this app's fault at this stage.",
        "No phone or battery issues on my samsung a5. Would like to see time shortened from 15 minutes to 1 or 2 minutes and warn me when I'm close to someone would be much better so I can move away. Otherwise it's fine. Can't see the point of having it if it waits 15 minutes to say I've been close to someone that's not good.",
        "26/7 notifications no longer stuffed, but weird location perm issues until reboot. 10/7 latest update has screwed up the notification bar, and somehow has stuffed up the notifications for other apps too. Will probably uninstall if not fixed soon. *Original Review*: Enrollment was pretty easy, the app is always running in the background but so far doesn't appear to be using the battery at all. Would trust it more if they used the Google/Apple framework, but sounds like that's a few weeks away..",
        "My phone started randomly crashing. Restart, open camera, open restart/power off menu, open Google pay, restart, open camera, restart and so on. It was like the power button was held down. I managed to stop the loop by deactivating Bluetooth which causes an error in the app. Tried some troubleshooting just to be sure then everything was fixed when I uninstalled the app. I'm on Google Pixel 3. Please fix",
        "I concur with some comments made about the latest update. It seems to use more battery, and there are occasionally issues with Bluetooth functionality. I use a Huawei Y5. My biggest beef is that since adding covidsafe, I have found my Facebook Lite app doesn't work properly. FB can't post or upload photos. Maybe there is a setting on the covidsafe app, which when switched on or off, will fix this annoyance. I wish I knew.",
        "I dont know what you have done with the latest update, but it has destroyed my battery power. I left the house for 3 hours for study and my phone died before returning home. Charged my phone to the same level when I got home with the app off and I only lost 2% battery power in the same amount of time. Useless if your phone dies while you're still out :/",
        "Best example of how to waste public money. How many contact traces done with this? App needed location access all time. But main purpose is to identify anybody come closer to 1.5m distance.. No logic at all. Battery drains rapidly, So need to charge phone one more time during the day. So many updates since first release, but no evidence of this app is working. Only good thing is keeping few people in job who built this app and staff working for the companies who ran 60+million campaign.",
        "Installed on the first go. No problems there. I have no issues the the surveillance conspiracies. But had to re-rate the app because it interferes with my podcast-to-car connection, and keeps turning off my podcast. So whenever I'm in the car, I have to force-stop the app so I can listen. And so sometimes I forget to turn it back on when I get out of the car.",
        "Extremely unclear as to why It requires GPS to be turned on all the time to work. From a security perspective it's unacceptable.",
        "Keeps switching off, telling me to switch battery optimisation off. No such thing on my phone."
