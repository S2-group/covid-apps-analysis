        "content": "Wow... really nice app with a huge amount of effort and hard work gone into making it accessible and helpful for our multi-lingual/-ethnic/-cultural Aussie families! I am totally blown away with all the different languages available and really impressed with the videos and visual instructions produced with voiceovers in those languages too.  We are all in it together regardless of how fluent we speak English. Outstanding example of community engagement & inclusivity!  Stay healthy everyone! \ud83d\ude0a",
