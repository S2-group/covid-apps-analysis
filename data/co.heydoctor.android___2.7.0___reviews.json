I had an IUD inserted not too long ago and got an infection. I started feeling the pain in the middle of the night and was scared the IUD would expell. Decided to give this a try and filled everything out from my bed, by morning I already had my prescription sent to a pharmacy and ready to pick up.

I've always hated paying a $60 copay and waiting around just to see a doctor to get a simple prescription that they write after seeing you for 5 seconds. This makes so much more sense to do that online. Especially in 2020 when I'm not too keen on going into a doctor's office in person unless necessary. Customer service is great too. I'm so glad I found this app.",

I was desperate and in horrible pain and could not get a hold of my general practitioner since the office was closed and with COVID-19 all the Urgent cares are temporarily closed. It was fast. I had to go to work and got my prescription in a matter of 30 minutes. The cost ended being less money than had I gone through my insurance. I will use it again. I am very, very pleased with the service.",

Thankfully, I found HeyDoctor, and for a total of $30, I filled out a form, had a doctor review my symptoms, and had my prescription sent to my pharmacy - all in under an hour. I'm ecstatic to say I'm getting my UTI treated for less time and money spent on going to a clinic, including when I had insurance. Seriously, this app is too good to be true.",
