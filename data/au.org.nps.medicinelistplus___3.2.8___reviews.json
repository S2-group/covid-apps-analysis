        "content": "Sadly I will be deleting this one excellent useful app because of the changes. MedicineWise have confirmed that part of the reasoning for the new requirement for login is to enable this to store the Medicine list on their Cloud based system instead of on the phone that the app is installed on - some people (me included) regard our list of medicines that we take as very private data and most are not willing to have it stored online. In my opinion the sudden new requirements and change have been badly managed and the fact that everybody all of a sudden lost their reminders was unforgivable. I will be uninstalling the app unless the previous version is reinstated and the new version is rolled back. My medical privacy is more important to me than the developers wish to take my data online.",
